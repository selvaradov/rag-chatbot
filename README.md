## Instructions for use
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. I'm using Python 3.10
- Download the `content` folder from Google Drive and put it into the root of this directory (i.e. you should have `./content/tables`, `./content/unstructured`)
- Run `app.py`
- Open `index.html` in your browser
